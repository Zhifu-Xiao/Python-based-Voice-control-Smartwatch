## TA checked three checkpoints on Wednesday (11/8)

Reference:
I used the sample code from Google Cloud Platform as the starter code for the Android application. I made several major changes based on that:
1. I added two new layouts displaying the return messages and possible error messages.
2. I added a textview to input ip addresses, and a button to test connection.
3. I implemented the sendMessage function to send GET message to the board and receive the feedback messsage.
Besides that, I also used and modifyed the code for establishing the python HTTP server. The links are shown below:
